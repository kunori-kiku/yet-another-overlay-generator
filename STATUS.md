## Active work

- **🚧 `v2.0.0-rc.10` — READY-AND-UNCUT (2026-07-16; not yet published).** This candidate completes
  the active-telemetry observation framework introduced in rc.9. Nodes still perform bounded signed
  ICMP/TCP observations and upload them over the existing authenticated HTTP heartbeat; the controller
  now retains/deduplicates the attempts, serves exact-probe latency/availability history, and rolls
  wide requests into one epoch-stable shared **1000-bucket response budget**. Fleet offers Auto plus
  explicit Resolution choices, discloses the controller's effective/widened step, labels multi-day
  axes with dates, and never downloads the raw retained file merely to draw a wide graph. Live uses a
  completion-based ten-second, node-only observation read with a dedicated transient freshness clock,
  visible progress/countdown/delayed/stale feedback, hidden-tab pause, context-scoped single-flight,
  last-good preservation, and explicit history Retry for quiet/offline nodes. Future telemetry is
  structurally forced through a shared catalog that declares every metric charted or live-only and
  drift-gates agent producers, controller projectors, API families, wire DTOs, and frontend renderers.
  **Explicit RC policy exception:** although `RELEASING.md` normally limits RCs to fixes, the owner
  explicitly instructed us to complete and ship this bounded telemetry follow-up in rc.10. It
  preserves authenticated HTTP, the rc.9 signed-policy/capability boundary, rollback compatibility,
  and existing-user behavior; the exception does not broaden future RC scope. No WebSocket/gRPC
  listener, arbitrary command surface, new node privilege, WebAuthn enforcement, or fleet re-sign is
  introduced.

  Fresh independent storage/security, frontend/UX, and architecture/hygiene review found and closed
  two blocker classes before publication. Fleet Live no longer downloads the full up-to-10,000-entry
  audit chain plus Settings/keystone every ten seconds, cannot borrow freshness from a topology save,
  and cannot join a hanging request from an old controller/auth context. Retention-cap startup and
  ordinary settings reads now use side-effect-free seed-if-absent plus backend-ordered cache
  publication, so a stale read cannot overwrite a newer operator enable/disable. Focused deterministic
  race tests exercise both interleavings, and a new real-route Playwright scenario covers exact probe
  switching, Live feedback, and retaining the last good charts across one injected history failure.

  Final local evidence after those fixes is green: gofmt, vet, the full Go race suite, coverage floors,
  wire drift, the generated PowerShell contract test, DAST, `govulncheck`, frontend lint/controller/
  local/WASM builds, **365 Vitest cases**, the 25-fixture WASM/Go byte-equality gate, and the required
  Playwright matrix (**77 passed, 6 expected project skips**). The exact-22 release-asset positive and
  adversarial contract suite is green. **Recorded residuals:** local native `pwsh` is unavailable, so
  GitHub's required runner must execute that contract before merge; the final local
  `docker buildx build --check` could not re-resolve `docker/dockerfile:1` because Docker Hub reset the
  connection twice (the unchanged Docker/release contract had already passed, and CI/release will
  re-run it); and an rc.10-agent/real-node ICMP-permission + response-header-stripping soak is **owed
  (owner-authorized release risk under the explicit ship instruction)** rather than claimed as a
  hardware pass. Required main CI still supplies the native PowerShell, real-tunnel, clean-checkout,
  and container-build evidence.

  **Remaining before tag:** commit and publish this exact reviewed scope as a PR, merge only after all
  required checks pass, wait for current-main CI on the merge commit, synchronize a clean
  `HEAD == origin/main`, create one annotated `v2.0.0-rc.10` tag at that exact tip, and let the sealed
  release workflow publish/verify all 22 assets plus the native two-platform controller image. Move
  this ledger to published/shipped wording only after GitHub Latest and GHCR/container Latest are
  independently verified.

- **✅ SUBJECT `post-refactor-debt-paydown-2026_07_14` — COMPLETE 2026-07-15 (14/14 merged; archived to
  `_completed/`). Thirteen non-held plans shipped as `v2.0.0-rc.6`; held plan-6 was redesigned before
  release, and its compatibility-preserving enrollment UV plus custody/publication-integrity follow-up
  shipped as `v2.0.0-rc.8`. The intermediate rc.7 identity is withdrawn and preserved after its
  versioned image crossed the non-overwrite boundary with a malformed arm64 child.** The successor to
  `framework-refactor`, from
  a fresh **30-agent repo-wide debt sweep + a 7-agent security-correctness gap-pass** (both briefed to
  NOT re-report shipped work) → **14 plans in 4 tiers**:
  correctness/security fixes → structural paydown → machine-gate/FE → doc/state hygiene. Executed per-PR
  with the full review regime (build → independent workflow review → fix → re-review → CI-green → merge),
  gated by an **18-agent pre-execution plan review** (GO-WITH-FIXES; caught 3 real blockers before any
  code — plan-3 fixed 1/4 SNAT sites + invented a divergent teardown, plan-5's lockTenantOps unreachable,
  plan-9's field_safety infeasible) and a **10-agent adversarial review-at-last** (GO-WITH-FIXES; both
  findings fixed — #291 stray wasm, #292 client-mimic). Folder:
  [`implementation_plans/_completed/post-refactor-debt-paydown-2026_07_14/`](implementation_plans/_completed/post-refactor-debt-paydown-2026_07_14/outline.md)
  (+ `ASSESSMENT.md` evidence base, `REVIEW-CORRECTIONS.md`). **Headline defects, all fixed at root +
  regression-pinned:** (1) the WASM engine (default+only in-browser local engine) was NEVER built in the
  release/Docker pipelines → every shipped panel 404s on `/yaog.wasm`, CI-invisible → **now built in both
  + red-build asserted + fault-tolerant load** (#278); (2) standalone `install.sh` root-installed an
  attacker `.deb` — an unlisted `artifacts.json` passed `bundle.sig`+`sha256sum -c` (the agent path is
  guarded at `verify.go:225`, the shell mirror was not) → **coverage guard mirrored into the shell,
  fail-closed** (#277); (3) `deploy.go --uninstall` orphaned mimic (root eBPF) + drifted on the SNAT
  delete → **mimic teardown + CIDR-agnostic SNAT in both shells** (#279, +#292 client-mimic); (4) the
  self-update **exact-vs-semver** comparator wedged the whole channel on a `v`-less target → **routed
  through `compareVersions` + a 256 MiB cap** (#280); (5) the trust-list-sign vs re-stage custody race →
  **one `lockTenantOps` over read+guard+verify+write + a durable-only `GetNodeRecord`** (#281). Plus the
  Tier-2/3/4 paydown (agent `ControllerLoop` #283, byte-identical `derivePeersWithDomains` split #284,
  `handler_bootstrap` split + agent-mux adapter #285, the non-vacuous wire-DTO drift gate #286, finished
  `Field` adoption #287, six-subject archive + reconcile #288, airgap/TS-compiler prose purge #289,
  pipeline/Docker hygiene #290). **Negative evidence: NO trust-root bypass, NO key leak, NO shipped CVE —
  the controller/agent-managed paths are sound; the defects lived in the mirrors/edges.** Owner scope
  decisions taken provisionally during execution now stand (comprehensive/all-4-tiers ·
  fix-ship-breaker-first-no-out-of-band-release · ran-the-security-pass · name). **✅ plan-6 (WebAuthn UV,
  #282) MERGED 2026-07-15, THEN SUPERSEDED BEFORE RELEASE:** a blanket runtime requirement would have
  changed the acceptance contract underneath existing users, potentially locking out credentials they
  had already enrolled and making upgraded nodes reject the fleet's currently served manifest. The rc.7
  implementation verifies UV only while a new browser credential is enrolled: login and keystone
  enrollment each use an authenticated, purpose+actor-scoped, one-use server challenge and a second
  assertion by the exact candidate credential before persistence. Normal login/signing/membership
  remains signature + binding + User-Presence verified; the first-party browser prefers UV for later
  assertions without requiring it, and both enrollment surfaces warn that a later non-UV assertion is
  possession-only. WebAuthn backup/sync state is separate from UV. **The initial rc.7 tag run failed
  before GitHub Release publication because checkout flattened the local annotated tag; after the
  centralized fix and documented pre-boundary retag, Release run `29437046676` passed every gate, the
  exact-22 asset check, and native Windows execution, then published the policy-non-overwritten version
  image at immutable digest `sha256:7e71e286…`. Its new
  read-back verifier incorrectly reused the multi-arch parent digest across sequential amd64/arm64 runs
  on Docker's classic image store, so no GitHub release object was created and Latest remained rc.6
  throughout that failed transaction.
  Direct extraction then found the deeper, pre-existing build defect: `ARG TARGETARCH=amd64`, present
  since the first controller image, masked BuildKit's automatic arm64 target and copied the same x86-64
  server into both children (rc.6 is affected too). The attempted child-digest-only verifier would have
  falsely passed because the x86 host can execute that mislabeled static binary. rc.7 is therefore
  preserved but withdrawn under the non-overwrite policy; neither Latest pointer moved during rc.7.
  The fix inherits automatic target arguments, asserts Go build metadata, and verifies each extracted
  ELF machine before runtime execution. Final edge run `29445582728` at exact release source `6b99a20`
  built both native children and passed the exact-child verifier (`amd64 e_machine=62`;
  `arm64 e_machine=183`). Release run `29445833406` then passed all gates, published the exact 22
  assets and native image, and promoted GitHub/GHCR Latest to rc.8. No fleet re-sign is required and
  existing manifests remain valid.**
  The merged implementation also reconciles the bilingual operator wiki and
  controller-agent lifecycle documentation. Deferred, non-blocking: **plan-3.5**
  (go:embed/`ShellToken` PowerShell deploy templating —
  no PS1 `ShellToken` constructor yet). Memory: `post-refactor-debt-paydown-shipped.md`.

- **📋 SUBJECT `mixed-controller-local-mode-2026_06_25` — PARTIALLY SHIPPED; still ACTIVE (plans 5 + 7
  pending).** The owner-chosen **Hybrid Kit (Option C)**: mark individual nodes `deployment_mode: manual`
  (no agent) inside a controller-managed topology — the controller compiles + signs their bundle exactly
  like any managed node, the operator installs it by hand, and a one-shot on-box `yaog-agent kit` does
  keygen → descriptor → register → private-key splice. Zero-knowledge custody stays inviolable; manual
  nodes are signed-membership members (D4) and appear "manual/unmonitored", excluded from convergence
  (D3). **Six of eight plans MERGED** (plan-1/2/3/4/6/8; PRs #196–#202 — the self-update reliability
  rider plan-8 = #201), all shipped in **`v2.0.0-beta.15`** (CHANGELOG roll #203). **Remaining before
  this subject closes: plan-5 (optional telemetry-only reporter for manual nodes) + plan-7 (release +
  owner two-node-with-one-manual smoke).** Folder:
  [`implementation_plans/mixed-controller-local-mode-2026_06_25/`](implementation_plans/mixed-controller-local-mode-2026_06_25/outline.md).

- **✅ SUBJECT `telemetry-history-and-delta-deploy-2026_07_13` — DELIVERED as `v2.0.0-rc.5` (GitHub
  *Latest*, 2026-07-13; annotated tag on `ac3d660`; rc.4 demoted; self-promoted; 29 assets);
  CLOSED + archived to `_completed/`.** All 8 plans merged (PRs #249–#257), each independently
  workflow-reviewed → fixed → re-reviewed → CI-green → merged. **(A) Resource history + charts** — agent
  `cpu_pct` (stateful `/proc/stat` jiffies delta; first-beat gap, never a fabricated 0); controller
  keeps a bounded per-node history (in-memory O(1) append — the heartbeat NEVER fsyncs — + a 5-min
  off-heartbeat flusher → append-only per-node JSONL with amortized compaction; configurable cap
  `TelemetryHistoryCap` nil⇒20160≈7d/0⇒off, a persisted 0 surviving restart via `capLoader`); operator
  `node-history` query aggregates server-side (avg/min/max, gaps omitted, step floor 1s/widen ≤1000);
  panel charts via lazy Recharts behind a reusable series-generic `TimeSeriesChart`. **(B) Delta deploy**
  — per-node skip on `hex(sha256(checksums.sha256))` (excludes volatile `compiled_at`) → unchanged node
  keeps its generation → its agent never re-fetches (mixed-gen fleet); FAIL-OPEN; keystone-aware disable
  on first-pin/rotation; zero-changed short-circuit PURGES lingering staged bundles; `WithForceAll`/
  `WithForceNodes` (drift/rescue) + `DeployPreview` (canvas dry-run, best-effort "Deploy anyway").
  **(plan-1.5) Telemetry-freshness FRAMEWORK fix** for the recurring "a new metric only fires at deploy
  time, then freezes" class: metrics ride the `Sampler` heartbeat as the SOLE producer (`/report` =
  conditions only) + a coalescing post-apply kick; conditions stay dual-write. Review caught 3 real
  defects pre-merge (plan-5 zero-changed custody blocker; plan-6 preview-vs-canvas mismatch + hard-block;
  plan-7 doc "single producer of conditions" overstatement). Memory:
  `telemetry-history-and-delta-deploy-shipped.md`. **Owed (owner): update the controller to rc.5 +
  browser-smoke the charts (granularities + cap incl. 0=off) and delta deploy (unchanged topology →
  "0 updated, N unchanged", NO node refresh; change one → only it refreshes; Force redeploys an unchanged
  node). A defect during the rc.5 soak → rc.6 under the same gate rules.**

- **✅ SUBJECT `mimic-fleet-robustness-2026_07_07` — DELIVERED as `v2.0.0-rc.4` (GitHub *Latest*,
  2026-07-07; tag on `cbe0735`; rc.3 demoted; self-promoted); CLOSED + archived to `_completed/`.**
  The rc.3-soak fleet findings, each fixed per-PR (independent workflow review → fix → re-review → CI
  green → merge): (1) mimic build deps — **`bubblewrap`** + **`dwarves`**, which mimic-dkms's DKMS
  build needs but declares neither, now `_pm_install`ed in the provisioning step AND the
  `_mimic_module_ready` retry (#241; the retry locus was the review catch — a binary-present but
  module-unbuilt node short-circuits provision on `command -v mimic`); (2) unconditional Phase-0
  teardown so tcp→udp de-provisions the stale `mimic@` (#241); (3) live mimic condition — re-probes
  `systemctl is-active mimic@<egress>` each heartbeat → a `Stopped` warn (#242); (4) relay-path warning
  `validation_edge_mimic_relay_path` — mimic needs a direct L3/L4 path, no L7 relay (#243); (5) docs
  (#244); rc.4 roll (#245). **Deferred (out of scope):** auto-coordinated fallback (telemetry→compile;
  the clean fix for a genuinely-unbuildable node is `transport: udp` both ends). **Owed (owner):**
  update the controller to rc.4 + redeploy the fleet (fixes are in the rendered `install.sh`, not the
  agent binary; `apt-get install -y bubblewrap dwarves` is now automatic on redeploy); set L7-relay
  edges to `transport: udp`. Memory: `mimic-fleet-robustness-shipped.md`.

- **✅ SUBJECT `mimic-runtime-reliability-2026_07_06` — DELIVERED as `v2.0.0-rc.3` (GitHub *Latest*,
  2026-07-06; tag on `2ad18f2`; rc.2 demoted; self-promoted; 29 assets); CLOSED + archived to
  `_completed/`.** The rc.2 live-fleet smoke (node hkg14) found `transport:
  tcp` failing at RUNTIME after the rc.2 install fix: mimic exit-22 (`is the Mimic kernel module
  loaded?`) → `dkms status: mimic/0.7.1 **added**` (never built) → `linux-headers-6.1.0-13-cloud-amd64`
  **pruned from the repo** (node on a stale kernel since Dec-2024, never rebooted). ROOT DEFECT:
  `_mimic_provision` (`script.go:593`) declares success on `command -v mimic` (BINARY only), never
  verifying the DKMS **module** built/loads — so it proceeds to a broken start; and on a
  `mimic_fallback: udp` link the false-success **skips the UDP fallback** (silent no-degrade).
  Secondary: the rc.2 `restart` change can orphan `/run/mimic/*.lock` → exit-17 wedge. **5 plans:**
  (1) module build/load verification + honor-policy (`module_unavailable` outcome/condition) + lock
  cleanup + `modprobe` on start [FLEET-CRITICAL] · (2) per-node egress-interface override (owner ask)
  · (3) pre-deploy "can this node run mimic" capability probe + panel warning · (4) docs + proof · (5)
  release rc.3. Posture: detect + honor policy + clear "reboot into the current kernel" guidance —
  install.sh NEVER auto-swaps a kernel. Plan folder:

  MERGED, + plan-5 (#239, CHANGELOG) + the `v2.0.0-rc.3` tag CUT (owner: "cut now"). Release verified:
  29 assets, GitHub Latest (rc.2 demoted; self-promoted). **Owed: owner updates the controller to rc.3
  + re-deploys the affected fleet nodes** — the fix is in the rendered `install.sh`, delivered by the
  controller, NOT the agent binary, so cutting rc.3 makes it available but the operator applies it by
  updating the controller + redeploying. A defect during soak → rc.4 under the same gate rules. Owner
  unblock still valid (udp fallback / reboot into the current kernel).

  (the DKMS eBPF module, which **Provides** the `mimic-modules` the `mimic` pkg **Depends** on). YAOG's

  Release workflow green (29 assets incl. per-arch `yaog-agent-*` + `.sha256` pins) → promoted to
  Latest. Plans:
  - **Security:** plan-2 CRITICAL self-update keystone bypass on the deferred-retry swap (#208) ·

    `v2.0.0-rc.1`). Owner chose "beta.17 now → smoke → rc.1".

### Prior release history

- **Released:** **`v2.0.0-beta.8`** (GitHub *latest*) — pre-rc.1 blocker hotfix (PR #136). Fast-tracked six
  investigation-confirmed blockers: fleet-mux panic recovery (B1), keystone-sign-on-refresh 401 (F1),
  babeld.conf byte-stability under edge reorder (C1), and enrollment-lifecycle hardening (S4 revoked-
  resurrection guard, S5 enrollment-token purge-on-revoke, S6 TTL cap). Independent review GO (0 findings)
  → CI + Release + Docker green.
- **Drafted (awaiting execution + owner sign-off on 3 pending decisions):** the **pre-rc.1 program** —
  `implementation_plans/_completed/pre-rc1-2026_06_18/` (outline + 22 plan files across 4 subjects: refactor+security →
  phone UX → full-stack simulation → security audit again → rc.1). Built via the `draft-implementation-plan`
  skill from a 55-agent investigation → adversarial critique → coherence reconciliation. Pending owner
  decisions: air-gap removal mechanism (build-tag vs delete), transit-CIDR const home, rc.1 `--prerelease`.
- **Released:** **`v2.0.0-beta.7`** (superseded by beta.8) — edge-pin-collision root-cause fix (PR #135).
  Fixed the **"pin occupied by two different links"** corruption the operator hit on a live fleet
  (validate showed 10 errors while incremental deploys looked fine). Root cause: incremental
  enrollment compiles only the enrolled subgraph (dropping not-yet-enrolled edges), so the allocator's
  gap-fill restarted each pool from the bottom without seeing the dropped edges' pins, handing two
  edges that were never compiled together the same transit IP / port / link-local. **Prevent:**
  subgraph compiles now **reserve out-of-subgraph edge pins** (into both endpoint domains' pools) so a
  new node's links never re-use a live link's resource — full compiles byte-for-byte unchanged.
  **Clean:** `internal/normalize.HealCollidingPins` (inverse of the validator's cross-link dedup)
  strips the colliding edge so it re-allocates fresh, wired at the `update-topology` write path, at
  `CompileAndStage` start (**deploy self-heals** an already-corrupt fleet), and on every panel canvas
  load (TS mirror). Verified against the real topology: **10 collisions → 0.** Also: **controller-mode
  design Export/Import** (server-authoritative — strip keys → update-topology → re-hydrate; no
  localStorage fleet-data leak; never auto-deploys) and an edge-inspector port-label clarification
  (names the node, display-only). Reviewed by an independent 4-dimension workflow (GO, 0 blockers) →
  findings applied (multi-CIDR superset reservation, heal-on-stage, TS↔Go heal parity) → full suite +
  `tsc -b` + eslint green; CI green.
- **Prior releases:** **`v2.0.0-beta.6`** — fleet/keystone operability (PR #134, atop
  #133), bundling the bugs surfaced during live fleet operation. A stuck "Roll keys" rotation can now
  be released without evicting the node (`POST {operator}/clear-rekey`, idempotent + audited +
  strictly weaker than revoke; per-node **"Cancel rekey"** button); the panel's **Deploy gate is
  advisory** (a `window.confirm`), not a hard block, so a single offline straggler no longer wedges
  every deploy; an **edge role flip no longer corrupts allocation pins** (the editor now clears all
  six `pinned_*` + `compiled_port`, with a pure/idempotent **load-time auto-heal**
  `healDuplicatePinnedBackups` that strips a backup's pins iff its transit IPs collide with a same-pair
  primary); the **fleet view reflects server truth without a re-login** (refresh-on-auth on
  Fleet/Deploy + immediate refresh when "Live" is enabled); and **bootstrap re-pins the operator
  credential by default + `systemctl restart`s the agent** (#133) so a re-bootstrap's new
  token/credential actually takes effect. Reviewed by an independent multi-dimension workflow (GO, 0
  blockers) → nits applied → full suite + `tsc -b` + eslint green; CI green.
- **`v2.0.0-beta.5`** — keystone-rotation safety (PRs #129/#130/#131
  + #132). Reproduced and fixed the root cause where rotating the off-host operator credential
  silently stranded the whole fleet: a changed credential now requires an acknowledged rotation, the
  controller exposes a server-truth `redeploy_required` signal, and the agent gains
  `reprovision-keystone`. A non-release adversarial regression suite (`internal/regression`) then
  surfaced three adjacent trust-list-serving bugs — all fixed: the **served-vs-staged trust-list
  split** (a mid-deploy re-stage no longer bricks `/config`), a **monotonic anti-rollback floor**
  across a keystone-OFF apply, and an **atomic `GetServedConfig`** snapshot (no torn bundle/manifest
  pair); plus `keystone_no_signed_manifest` reclassified 500→409. **`v2.0.0-beta.4`** — a security hardening fix (PR #128): the
  controller persists the bundle-signing **public** key per tenant (`SigningAnchor`) and reconciles
  it at stage time, so a redeploy that drops or swaps `YAOG_BUNDLE_SIGNING_KEY` now FAILS LOUD
  (`signing_key_missing` 412 / `signing_key_mismatch` 409) instead of silently shipping unsigned
  bundles. Trust-on-first-use; rotation via `YAOG_BUNDLE_SIGNING_KEY_ROTATE`; private key stays
  off-host; pin/rotate audited; air-gap export unchanged. **`v2.0.0-beta.3`** — the operator-panel UI for agent self-update +
  canary-then-fleet (the descoped plan-9 "Canary UI"): agent + mimic config cards, assisted
  release-pin fetch (`POST /release-pins`, SSRF-guarded), per-node update-status chip + opt-in live
  poll, the full-replace drop-on-save fix (PRs #121–#126). Atop **`v2.0.0-beta.2`** /
  **`v2.0.0-beta.1`** (`signed-self-update-and-rc-hardening`, PRs #109–#118).

## Open questions / blockers

- **Owed manual smokes (owner-accepted risk), gate rc.1 — not code-merge:** the nine beta.1–Subject-2
  owed smokes are triaged (9 → 3 irreducible owner-run legs + 1 open dependency) in
  [`docs/spec/rc1/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/spec/rc1/RUNBOOK.md), with their live A/B/C state in the criterion-C1
  ledger of [`docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md`](docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md). Not re-listed here (single source of
  truth — no third drift surface).
- **rc.1 gates on [`docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md`](docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md); the owner signs the go/no-go
  there.** That document is the single source of truth for the criteria (A–E), the owed-smoke ledger (it
  references `docs/spec/rc1/RUNBOOK.md`), the required-checks set, and the release runbook.
- **Deferred to rc.2/GA** (documented, not built): the bootstrap-TOFU hole (the agent's first binary
  is fetched without a pre-shared pin); the FileStore SPOF (global mutex + 200ms generation poll) fix;
  a reliable *persistent* per-node `failed` update-state (would need a positive agent-reported field —
  the chip's `failed` is best-effort/transient today); the full wiki rewrite; a frontend test runner.
- `v2.0.0-rc.8` shipped the reviewed enrollment-compatibility, custody, release-integrity, and native
  multi-platform controller work. PR #302 merged the Dockerfile/verifier correction as
  `a73ce55aa05effbff7df6533b03c34e35427f0cd`; PR #303 merged the final release state as exact tag target
  `6b99a20bfe8455cce5e410330518ca6b97501cb2`. Exact-main CI run `29445184407` passed all seven required
  jobs, and final edge run `29445582728` proved that exact source: parent
  `sha256:7384d6f8f395250f1342cf9476011fc02ee12d5468324b4f55a6545c95064894`, amd64 child
  `sha256:a0ed03e3245982ff2dcf9cc0fa3abcfd2a8d0b5a7bf3ec921f3089cb45f3e8a4`
  (`e_machine=62`), and arm64 child
  `sha256:9b8ef60bebb7f6f0453c1eefa73ead365f8d64791715ddf00b3b361af871298d`
  (`e_machine=183`), with exact configs and QEMU-backed runtime versions. Annotated tag object
  `5535834866ebe5ead244131e6005b4c438cbe575` targets that commit. Ordinary Release run `29445833406`
  completed successfully with 23 green jobs and one expected preview/beta publisher skip, published a
  public/non-prerelease GitHub Latest with exactly 22 independently downloaded-and-reverified assets,
  and promoted both GHCR `2.0.0-rc.8` and `latest` to verified parent
  `sha256:1fa7a64e6524c6400695f1e5eafb7cc3b35d500486de0e3df9aa3dee4499fe15`. Its runtime children are
  amd64 `sha256:4febaf16a5034e594ff840a202417dc7ca3937958a407b69c2686fa3773d4d76`
  (`e_machine=62`) and arm64
  `sha256:710d0e2f46f571922fb096bdeed05003188765d2208e35ee7425a33e464777b8`
  (`e_machine=183`); both carry the exact platform, revision, version, and server entrypoint, and the
  release runner executed both under its QEMU-backed verifier. The withdrawn rc.7 tag and malformed
  immutable image remain preserved; no rc.7 GitHub Release exists and recovery, overwrite, promotion,
  or identity reuse remains forbidden. The retained rc.6 and withdrawn rc.7 versioned arm64 controller
  children remain unusable; standalone arm64 agents/bundles are unaffected. Hardware-backed browser
  enrollment remains an explicit owner smoke.

## Next actions

**Two current tracks:**

**Track 1 — `post-refactor-debt-paydown-2026_07_14` COMPLETE + archived to `_completed/`.** All 14 plans
merged to `main` (#277–#290, +#291/#292 review follow-ups), each workflow-reviewed → fixed → re-reviewed →
CI-green. Thirteen non-held plans plus the review follow-ups shipped as `v2.0.0-rc.6`; held plan-6
(WebAuthn UV, #282) merged 2026-07-15 but its blanket runtime/node gate never reached a published
release. The compatibility-preserving replacement in the withdrawn rc.7 tag shipped in rc.8. It
verifies a purpose+actor-scoped UV proof from the exact candidate only when a login or keystone browser
credential is enrolled, with an explicit possession/copy warning in both panel surfaces. There is no
node-side UV migration and no mandatory trust-list re-sign. Full detail is in the ✅ closed entry above.
**Residual (non-blocking, its own future unit):** the go:embed/`ShellToken` PowerShell deploy templating
(plan-3.5). The bilingual wiki and controller-agent lifecycle prose are reconciled in the release.

**Track 2 — the rc line to GA.**

**`v2.0.0-rc.8` is GitHub Latest (2026-07-16; annotated tag targeting `6b99a20`; 22 verified assets;
GHCR `2.0.0-rc.8` and `latest` share verified parent `sha256:1fa7a64e…9fe15`). It carries the
enrollment-scoped UV, custody, and exact-publication follow-up plus the native multi-platform controller
correction. Historical warning: the retained `2.0.0-rc.6` and withdrawn `2.0.0-rc.7` versioned arm64
controller children remain malformed and must not be used. rc.7 remains preserved as failure evidence;
do not recover, overwrite, promote, or reuse that identity. Standalone arm64 agents and release bundles
are unaffected because they use the separate release matrix. The road to GA (hardware-only checks remain
owner-paced):**
1. **Carry the real-host/browser smokes as explicitly owed risk where hardware is unavailable.**
   Owner owes: update the controller to rc.8 and browser-smoke
   the fixes — (a) **local in-browser design now actually loads** (the shipped panel finally contains
   `yaog.wasm`: design → Validate → compile → export with no backend — the headline fix); (b) deploy a
   `transport: tcp` node then run the deploy-script `--uninstall` → the `mimic@` unit is stopped/disabled
   and the overlay SNAT rules are gone (incl. a non-default transit CIDR); (c) `install.sh` still installs
   a legit bundle cleanly (the new signed-set guard only rejects a *tampered* unlisted `artifacts.json`);
   (d) self-update across the rc.5→rc.6 boundary reconciles (no channel wedge). The install.sh +
   deploy-script fixes ride the rendered scripts, so **update the controller and redeploy** to apply.
   Release cut hit a real `release.yml` E2E-gate gap (it wasn't building the wasm before the E2E panel
   build — fixed #295, tag moved to the fixed commit); rc.6's GitHub assets are correct, but its arm64
   controller image is not. Any confirmed rc.8 defect advances to rc.9 (a red required gate or a new
   blocker never tags over).
2. **rc.5 surfaces to also smoke** (carried, not yet owner-confirmed): the node-detail CPU/RAM/load
   charts (granularities + retention cap incl. `0`=off) and delta deploy (unchanged topology →
   "0 updated, N unchanged", no node refresh; change one → only it re-stages; Force redeploys an
   unchanged node). **STILL owed from rc.4:** set L7-relay edges to `transport: udp`. The single
   controller-update + redeploy to rc.8 covers the carried rc.4/rc.5/rc.6 smokes at once.
3. **rc.x backlog (deliberate deferrals, unchanged):** FileStore host-loss SPOF (backup/restore/HA — see
   the persisted encrypted-object-storage plan), bootstrap-TOFU first-fetch pinning + operator-cred OOB
   delivery, the pinned-endpoint anti-roaming re-assert option (owner decision open), the `EDGE_OMITEMPTY`
   `mimic_fallback` canonicalization gap, the auto-coordinated mimic fallback (deferred), and the Dockerfile-vs-go.mod toolchain
   alignment note.
4. **GA when the rc line has soaked clean** — per `RELEASING.md`'s ramp.

Operational note (unchanged): a CI job display-name change silently orphans its required
branch-protection context — update protection in the same PR as any `name:` edit in `ci.yml`.

Historical (rc.1 shipped 2026-07-03, GitHub Latest at the time): the pre-rc.1 program (Subjects 1–4,
PRs #137–#159), the rc.1 go/no-go gate ([`docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md`](docs/spec/rc1/RC1-GATE.md), closed
GO with zero exceptions), and the `link-directionality` NAT/roaming fix (single-link the accelerator
edge so the reverse peer can't race the relay; folded into rc.1) are all delivered + archived. The
release line has since advanced preview → beta → rc through **rc.8**.
